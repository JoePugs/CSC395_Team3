Team Three is satisfied with our progress during Sprint 1. Besides the Ollama connection, the team as completed all the tickets with the first sprint of Milestones. 
We have successfully implemented a Dockerfile that contains the python Flask. The docker-compose.yml is able to build the Docker and incorporates the Flask without issues. 
In addition to completed tickets, we have outlined the basic commands and layout of the UI within the index.html file. The web browser link to our UI works within any browser. 
Our python Flask app.py is completed and runs with no errors. Communication and having teammates following through on their assigned work is responsible for having great progress.

Within this first sprint, the only challenging part we've come across is connected the Ollama API with the Flask. Through minor test trials, we are noting that our Flask is successfully receiving 
the JSON data from input but cannot send it to the Ollama API. We are having troubles implementing Ollama due to failed port connection with the Flask and Ollama, despite the Ollama URL and Flask
running on the same port. Our solution is to have the instructor take a look and see what piece of code we are missing in order for these systems to effectively commmunicate. 

Another challenge is Mark's role being in charge of finalizing the UI depsite never coding in HTML. However, off of Joey's recommendation, Mark is going to utlize w3school to help code in HTML 
while also viewing the changes of the code live. Both the code and the UI will be side-by-side, making it easier for beginers to understand their code edits. In addition to upcoming roles in 
this last sprint, Dante will be working on the Unit Testing and implementing the code examples given in the project rubric. 

After this week when Gabi has finished setting up Ollama, Mark has finalized the UI, and Dante has given feedback based on the Unit Testing and potential edits, we are coming together 
one last time for a final demo meeting to make sure the whole system works. We are doing this over zoom this Sunday at 3pm. The end goal with this meeting is to have a final product
that meets all requirements, ready for the demo presentation.
